      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">1. Nature of Services</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li>Waha Wonders provides AI-generated travel itineraries and cost estimates designed to help customers explore travel options within the UAE.</li>
        <li>Our AI system uses generative AI technology to suggest plans based on databases, assumptions, averages, and available reference material.</li>
        <li>The itineraries produced are illustrative and advisory in nature, and do not represent final confirmed bookings.</li>
        <li>All AI-generated outputs are subject to human validation, expert review, and customer approval before being finalized.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">2. Assumptions and Limitations of AI-Generated Plans</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li>AI-generated itineraries are based on assumptions, averages, and generalized data available in our system.</li>
        <li>Pricing shown may vary depending on:
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
            <li>Month or season of travel (e.g., peak season surcharges, holidays).</li>
            <li>Vendor pricing updates (hotels, attractions, transport providers).</li>
            <li>Government taxes or fuel surcharges.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>AI calculations are derived from average values and do not reflect guaranteed or exact costs.</li>
        <li>Data sources may include publicly available databases, internal records, and estimated market averages.</li>
        <li>Suggested travel durations, distances, and costs are approximations and not always aligned with actual traffic, availability, or operational conditions.</li>
        <li>Generated itineraries are not exhaustive or complete, and may not reflect all possible options or current promotions.</li>
        <li>AI recommendations are provided on an ‚Äúas is‚Äù basis, with no warranty of accuracy or completeness.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">3. Requirement for Expert Review & Confirmation</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li>Customers must engage with a Waha Wonders travel consultant for verification, customization, and finalization of any itinerary.</li>
        <li>Final itineraries require a signed agreement/confirmation between the customer and Waha Wonders.</li>
        <li>No travel service will be booked, confirmed, or guaranteed until such review and signed confirmation is completed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">4. Bookings and Payments</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li>AI-generated plans are indicative only and do not constitute a confirmed booking.</li>

        <li>Bookings are confirmed only after receipt of payment as specified by Waha Wonders.</li>
        <li>All prices are in AED (United Arab Emirates Dirham) unless stated otherwise.</li>
